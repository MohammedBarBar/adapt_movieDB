 * Wraps `lodash.isObject` to provide more useful type assertion return type
 * for many use cases. An example is performing runtime type checking
 * for type assertion functions where the caller wants to narrow
 * the type step by step, typically testing the object's properties as the
 * next step.
 *
 * The lodash version returns `val is object`, which has no index type and
 * no properties, which is more correct in some situations, but less useful
 * for the above use case.
